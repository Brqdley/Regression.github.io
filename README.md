# Framing the Problem
My prediction problem is estimating the number of customers affected by an electrical outage at the start of an outage.
I chose this variable because I think this would be useful by the electrical companies to gauge how much of an impact the outage will have,
so they know how much manpower to use.

At the time of predicting, the restoration dates, and the outage duration would not be available, 
as the values would not be available at the start of an outage.

Metric: Root Mean Squared Error
I used this metric because since this is a regression model, accuracy would not work, as that is for classifiers. Moreover,
